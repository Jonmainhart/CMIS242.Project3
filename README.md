# CMIS242.Project3
Third graded assignment for CMIS242 

This project allows the user to select solid or hollow rectangles and ovals, choose the color, input the size, and specify the location, then draw the shape in a predefined area. The program checks that the user input is valid and that the shape is within the given area through a simple collision detection algorithm. 

This project really took me out of my comfort zone and forced me to think about how objects are drawn on a screen as well as how to determine when drawn objects touch or overlap. 
During this project I used the following principles:
* Object Oriented Programming
* Defining Exceptions
* Defining and Extending Abstract Classes
* Creating a Collision Detection Algorithm
* Java Swing
* Java Graphics Class
* Java awt

This was a fun project which taught me a lot.
